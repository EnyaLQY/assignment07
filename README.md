# Typography Changes
I select a new pair of fonts from Google Fonts, which are Spartan and Montserrat [(See the popular pairings)](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Spartan?preview.text=TORONTO&preview.text_type=custom#pairings).

Previously, the content is not very readable due to the lack of spacing and kerning. The font of heading and body looks too similar, which might affect the legibility. Therefore, I use Spartan for headings and navigation bar, and Montserrat for the body text. I think both fonts belong the group of "Humanist Sans" since they are modern, clean and quite empathetic, which fit the mood of a city website in my perspective. And they can complement each other well, which increases the legibility.

In addition, I increase the line height of the paragraph and the margin between each paragraph, which make the body content look less condensed. With the help of new font, readers might be more likely to read through the content patiently and carefully. Also, I change the heading color from light blue to darker blue in order to make a contrast with the white background. I increase the font size, padding and margin of the big title and navigation items and change the color correspondingly so that the readability of this website increases.
